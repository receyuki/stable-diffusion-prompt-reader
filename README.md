If you are using a tool or format that is not on this list, please help me to support your format 
by uploading the original file generated by your tool as a zip file to the issues, thx.

## Download
### For macOS and Windows users
Download executable from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/receyuki/stable-diffusion-prompt-reader/releases/latest)
### For Linux users (not regularly tested)
~~I'm pretty sure linux users can figure things out without an executable.~~
1. Make sure you have the tkinter package installed in your Python.
If not, install the python3-tk package with package managers.  
e.g. `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` for Debian-based distributions
2. Clone this repo.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/receyuki/stable-diffusion-prompt-reader.git
    ```
   or download repo as a zip.
3. CD to the directory and install dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd stable-diffusion-prompt-reader  
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run.
    ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
### Read prompt
- Open the executable file (.exe or .app) and drag and drop the image into the window.

OR
- Right click on the image and select open with SD Prompt Reader

OR
- Drag and drop the image directly onto executable (.exe or .app).
### Export prompt to text file
- Click "Export to txt" will generate a txt file alongside the image file.
- To save to another location, click the expand arrow and click "select directory".

### Remove prompt from image
- Click "Remove Data" will generate a new image file with suffix "_data_removed" alongside the original image file.
- To save to another location, click the expand arrow and click "select directory".
- To overwrite the original image file, click the expand arrow and click "overwrite the original image".  
![export](/images/remove.png)

## Format Limitations
### ComfyUI
***Support for comfyUI requires more testing. If you believe your image is not being displayed properly, please upload the original file generated by ComfyUI as a zip file to the issues.***
1. If there are multiple sets of data (seed, steps, CFG, etc.) in the setting box, this means that there are multiple KSampler nodes in the flowchart.
2. Due to the nature of ComfyUI, all nodes and flowcharts in the workflow are stored in the image, including those that are not being used. Also, a flowchart can have multiple branches, inputs and outputs.
(e.g. output hires. fixed image and original image simultaneously in a single flowchart)
SD Prompt Reader will traverse all flowcharts and branches and display the longest branch with complete input and output.

## TODO
- Add Support for more tools
- Better settings display UI
- Ability to edit and write prompt back to PNG
- Batch image processing tool
